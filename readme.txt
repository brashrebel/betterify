== Description ==

Have you noticed that your site is lacking something? Are you experiencing problems with WordPress and/or a plugin and/or a theme and/or your indigestion? If this sounds like you, we recommend installing this plugin right away.

= What does it do? =

Betterify has been created with a single goal: to make every WordPress site better. And that is exactly what it does.

Here's a rundown of the technical features:

* Fixes serial class conflicts
* Reduces synchronized load caching errors
* Stabilizes transient MIME types
* Optimizes search parameters
* Filters `$post` meta scripts
* Cleanses nonce variants
* Improves global path modules
* Eliminates potentially harmful epoxy resins
* Removes subjectivity by objectifying everything 

And it does it all without requiring you to configure a single setting! So what are you waiting for? Activate Betterify today!

Also, Betterify is completely 100% compatible with VideoDash!

== Installation ==

Using this plugin is very simple. All you have to do is:

1. Upload the `betterify` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Show off your betterified site to your friends

4. Make a sandwich

== FAQ ==

= How does this plugin fix all the errors? =

We've written the code for this plugin in a completely PHP 5.3 compliant, Object Oriented, non-obfuscated way so that the detection of obstructed array methods will always pass through our normalize scripting processor. It is basically fool proof.

= I've activated the plugin but my site doesn't seem any better. Is something wrong? =

Most likely no. Try taking the following steps:

1. Reboot your computer
2. Clear your browser's cache
3. Navigate to your site's home page
4. Double click on the header and then on the footer (anywhere is fine)
6. Contact your ISP and request that they convert your protocol methods to SMTP
7. (Optional) Open a support thread [here](http://www.thesewingforum.co.uk/)
8. Unplug your modem, wait 30 seconds and plug it back in


If that doesn't work, try deactivating and then reactivating the plugin.

= I kind of thought my site was better before I activated Betterify. Should I just deactivate it? =

No.

= How can I ever thank you? =

Don't thank me. Thank the person on the plugin review team who actually let this plugin on the repository.

= Is this plugin actually a placebo? =

Yes.
